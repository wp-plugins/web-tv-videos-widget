== Description ==

This widget displays a list with links to the latest videos from TV channels and newssites about a certain topic in the sidebar. The topic can be freely chosen and can be a name of a popular person ("Britney Spears", "Steve Jobs", "Barack Obama", ....) you write about in your blog, a political or technical topic ("Egypt", "iPhone", ....), a name of a TV show ("60 minutes", "Tagesschau", ...) or anything you can imagine.

Videos will be updated every 30 minutes. At the moment, the plugin support video results from the U.S. and Germany, displaying entries from Channels like ABC, CBS, FOX, CNN or MSNBC when english videos are chosen and entries from Channels like Das Erste, ZDF, RTL, Sat1, Pro7, Dritte Programme, Spiegel Online or Sueddeutsche.de when german videos are selected.
